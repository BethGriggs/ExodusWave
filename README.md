# The Exodus Wave
---
The Exodus Wave is a visualisation tool implementing the Cesium.js library to map migrations that have occurred between the years 1960 to 2000.

To get going:

1. Clone the repository to a local directory
2. In your CLI, change your directory to the recently cloned projects and then start the application entering 'node app'
3. In your browser, navigate to 'localhost:8080' to view the visualisation

Much love, such thanks.
